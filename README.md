# CrateDB Alt panel - 0.1.8

This is an Admin panel that intends to support all the features from CrateDB 5.4+ and add extra
functionality to make the lives of CrateDB users easy.

## Features:

- Statistics: View your Node load, queries per second and query duration in live charts.
- Health: View your node health and node checks live.
- Console: Modern console with CrateDB syntax highlighting, code completion, different console tabs,
  cancel current running query, query history, auto format, live update.
- Tables: View the system and your user tables and views information, size, records, view schema,
  show create, drop table, data sampling, table querying and table creation from the UI.
- Cluster: View your cluster live information such as version, os info, loads, heap usage, disk
  usage and live view of the current running jobs.
- Users: View current existing users, users permissions, add new permission, revoke permissions,
  drop user, create user, alter user.
- Logs: Actions from the Admin UI (Example: drop table, create user, drop user..) are logged and can
  be filtered depending on the severity.

## Local project setup

```
# yarn
yarn

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# bun
bun install
```

## Run with docker

```shell
docker run -p 3000:80 surister/cratedbaltadmin:latest
```

## Solving the cors 'issue'

In order to be able to query CrateDB's API you will need to start the cluster with these options:

```
-Chttp.cors.enabled=true
-Chttp.cors.allow-origin=http://localhost:3000
```

https://cratedb.com/docs/crate/reference/en/5.4/config/node.html#cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors

An example in docker would be:

```shell
docker run --rm -d \
      --name=crate01 \
      --net=crate \
      -p 4200:4200 \
      --env CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g \
      crate -Cnetwork.host=_site_ \
            -Cnode.name=crate01 \
            -Chttp.cors.enabled=true \
            -Chttp.cors.allow-origin=http://localhost:3000
```

Bear in mind that if you run the admin panel from another port, it will have to match
the `http.cors.allow-origin` setting.

## CrateDB versions.

This panel supports v5.4.3 as the base version, any new version will be added afterward.

For maximum compatibility any new version feature will be added with a versioned Component, meaning
that those features will only be unlocked if your connected CrateDB cluster supports it.


## Known limitations

While it is my intention to fully support everything, it's a daunting task, it is a very complex
product, and it will take some time.

The following parameters are not supported in the Create table UI:

- routing.allocation.include.{attribute}
- routing.allocation.require.{attribute}
- routing.allocation.exclude.{attribute}

We do not support restoring a snapshot from a partition.
`PARTITION (partition_column = value [, ...])] [, ...]`

## Contributing

This project is currently being developed by me, but it's open for contributions, also if you
have some ideas, feature request or happen to find a bug, please let me know in an issue, so it can be addressed.
